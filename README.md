# kl-c172-hyperspeed
Cessna 172 (g1000) Hyperspeed Mod for MSFS 2020

## About
This package modifies the default C712 (g1000) aircraft in MSFS 2020 to allow it to acheive the maximum speed and altitude supported by the simulator.  While this started as an experiment to explore the limits of the simulator, considerable effort has been put into making it stable and flyable under a wide range of conditions.

## Installation
Copy the `kl-aircraft-c172` folder inside the zip file to your MSFS Community folder.   If you want to revert back to the default C172, just remove `kl-aircraft-c172` from the MSFS Community folder.
